=============STRUGGLE AND PROBLEMS===================

LINK = https://yourstory.com/2017/02/mukesh-ambani-failures/
LINK = https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reliance_Industries#Controversies

Treat your investors' money even more carefully than your own money. And secondly, you cannot do anything without the 
right team — these are the two non-negotiable for me,

said Mukesh Ambani, owner of the world's largest startup, Reliance Jio, at a Nasscom Leadership Forum in Mumbai 
recently.

The Ambani family holds around 45% of the shares in RIL.[76] Since its inception, the company was managed by its 
founder and chairman Dhirubhai Ambani. After suffering a heart attack in 1986, he handed over the daily operations of 
the company to his sons Mukesh Ambani and Anil Ambani. After the death of Dhirubhai Ambani in 2002, the management of 
the company was taken up by both the brothers. In November 2004, Mukesh Ambani, in an interview, admitted to having 
differences with his brother Anil over 'ownership issues'.[77] He also said that the differences "are in the private 
domain". The share prices of RIL were impacted by some margin when this news broke out. In 2005, after a bitter public 
feud between the brothers over the control of the Reliance empire, mother Kokilaben intervened to broker a deal 
splitting the RIL group business into the two parts.[78] In October 2005, the split of Reliance Group was formalized. 
Mukesh Ambani got Reliance Industries and IPCL. Younger brother Anil Ambani received telecom, power, entertainment and 
financial services business of the group. The Anil Dhirubhai Ambani Group includes Reliance Communications, Reliance 
Infrastructure, Reliance Capital, Reliance Natural Resources and Reliance Power.[79][80] 

The division of Reliance group business between the two brothers also resulted in de-merger of 4 businesses from 
RIL.[81][82] These businesses immediately became part of Anil Dhirubhai Ambani Group. The existing shareholders in RIL, 
both the promoter group and non-promoters, received shares in the de-merged companies

In May 2014, ONGC moved to Delhi High Court accusing RIL of pilferage of 18 billion cubic metres of gas from its 
gas-producing block in the Krishna Godavari basin.[83] Subsequently, the two companies agreed to form an independent 
expert panel to probe any pilferage.

Place in the Marketing mix of Reliance industries
Reliance Industries has nearly 123 subsidiaries and 10 associate firms. In the retail sector, it 
is the largest retailer with nearly 1466 outlets in India. All the outlets are located at prime 
locations with trained and efficient staff to garner maximum consumers.

It will be impossible to cover the number of cities and places that reliance industries has 
presence in across India. This statement itself gives you a point of view of the large operations 
that are the foundation of Reliance industries.
A fabric mill was established in the year 1966 at Naroda, Gujarat and this was the starting point 
of Reliance Industries. It has manufacturing plants at various convenient sites like Jamnagar. The 
petro chemical plant at Hazira was started in 1991.
The biggest Gas discovery was by Reliance Industriesat the Godavari- Krishna Basin. Reliance 
Industries is a very old hand at each stage of circulation whether manufacturing, or hiring 
wholesalers or contracting retailers. They have a wide network already in place for every facet 
like channel, intermediary or distribution and their sound mechanism has taken them to such 
unimaginable heights.

Price in the Marketing mix of Reliance industries
The pricing policy of Reliance Industries is different for different sectors. The policy for 
sectors such as retail, telecommunications and health care that are in direct contact with the 
consumers is mainly penetration pricing. This is because most of these sectors are question marks 
and their outcome is undetermined as of now. Retail and telecommunication both suffer huge losses 
but companies invest in them looking at the future.
If the fair pricing policy is in place, then automatically the volume will rise and in turn, it 
will lead to better revenues. The policy for the sector petrochemicals is different as it is 
dependent largely on the current global market, which is very flexible. The various market 
conditions along with the costing and promotional expenses determine the pricing policies of the 
company.
Reliance Industries has a special team of highly qualified individuals who are the main 
determining factors behind every pricing policies and decisions and this is arrived after a 
complete analysis and evaluation. In some sectors like Reliance Fresh showrooms, it has dropped 
the services of intermediaries and bought the items directly from its source and hence has been 
able to lower the prices of the products, due to which the sale is higher and it is able to 
survive in the tough retail business.
Promotions in the Marketing mix of Reliance industries
Reliance has eagerly utilized the available advertising tools so that the best marketing 
strategies could be implemented. Their promotional campaigns are clean, well made, trendy with an 
emotional touch and up to the mark to attract the consumers. Reliance Industries also announces 
discounts and schemes for its consumers.
However, promotions is a big expense for most companies and hence Reliance relies more on spending 
less on promotions and reducing the prices so that customers are attracted to the company. In 
fact, except for the retail sector, hardly any advertising is seen from Reliance. And even if it 
uses advertising, it uses more of BTL then ATL.
It has been a regular sponsor of sports activities and has bought an IPL (cricket team). It also 
holds various rehabilitation programs for the downtrodden people.

INTRODUCTION TO HUMAN RESOURCE MANAGEMENT

Human resource management refers to an assortment of policies used to systematize work in the 
employment relationship and centres on the management of work and the management of people who 
undertakes this work.

Therefore HRM is concerned with recruitment, selection, learning and development, reward, 
communication, teamwork and routine management. While it is relatively easy to list activities 
that make up HRM, It is a subject that stimulates much debate and disagreement.
The hr process is considered as important for the management of the consumer pleasure with human 
recourses. The clients find comfortable and will be satisfied when they understand the hr 
processes and how they are connected and the hr processes interact. Modern hr processes are 
measured and frequently analysed and identifies the irregularities in the activities and it brings 
the improvements for the benefits of the organisation.

The success of Human Resources Management is in the connection of all HR processes as they provide 
the adequate supports to workers and the managers. So the main aim of Human Resource Management is 
to keep the human capital ready for action on the market and the rational grouping of HR Processes 
helps to interact and manage the individual processes.

Every organisation has their own HR processes, but the main HR Processes are always same in all 
companies as it is the market HR Best Practices.

Human Resource Management is considered as a comparatively new approach to Personnel Management. 
HRM emphasizes primarily on its strategic contributions and its closer alignment to business, HRM 
is a vital component of any organization, its involvement among other components of line 
management is notable (Paauwe. J, Jan 2009). Paauwe further suggests that HRM aims on its ultimate 
goals such as High job performance, low absence and high cost effectiveness through the efficient 
utilization of the man power of the company. Human resource is really the major component of any 
organization, the success or failure of an organization heavily relies on its Man power 
management. Maslow's need Hierarchy theory is considered as guiding principle for HR Management 
across the globe. Maslow identified the very basics of human motivation factors. Following this 
principle it can be assumed that to motivate an employee HR manager should understand his level of 
expectations, potential of the employee, and should evaluate the performance before and after 
certain motivational measures implemented.

MAJOR HR ISSUES FACED BY RELIANCE COMMUNICATION
ISSUES IN RELIANCE COMMUNICATIONS
EMPLOYEE RETENTION
POOR HR POLICIES
CASH AND COMPENSATION ISSUES

1.CASH AND COMPENSATION ISSUES:

Cash and compensation issues is a major problem faced by HR managers in reliance communications. 
There is more pressure on HR function to pay more incentives and basic pay for the 
employees.However reliance paying basic salary to each individual employees the company faces more 
pressure to meet the employee beniefits .

2.EMPLOYEE RETENTION ISSUES:
Most of the companies face the same problem of employee lay-offs. So the organisation have to 
prevent the issue by retaining the employee by providing good working condition and benefits 
whichever the employees need. In reliance industries there are so many employees leave the company 
due to lack of co-ordination between workers. The organisation tries to check the issue but fails 
sometimes.

3. POOR HR POLICIES :
The plocies and practices adopted by the HR managers regarding their networking sector is an 
important example. They brought some new plans in mobile networking sector like low call rate for 
mobile users, low internet browsing charge.etc., but the competitors like AIRTEL communications, 
BSNL network, VODAFONE facilitated some more exciting offers than the reliance. In that situation 
the Reliance communication hesitated to change their HR policies and techniques.
 
From the graphical representation of reliances communications profit from 2007 to 2012, we can 
easily determine that the profit is coming down in last two years comparing to the past this is 
due to the poor HR issues as mentioned above.The company is earning a high growth in 2008 and 2009 
which is around 55000 million and it is dramatically falling down in the upcoming years.That means 
the company is facing some major HR issues and also high competition from other companies, so the 
organisation must change their HR policies eventually.

Overall, the company said, it has spent Rs 210 billion as capital expenditure in the March quarter 
at the consolidated level, of which Rs 140 billion was spent for the telecom business. As of March 
2018, the telecom business’ total debt was at Rs 570 billion and RIL’s gross debt was at Rs 2.19 
trillion.

===========LOSS STUDY=================

A loss-making company controlled by India's richest man, Mukesh Ambani, who heads the country's 
biggest private corporate entity, Reliance Industries Limited, has successfully managed to 
reschedule repayments of its loans to banks. Reliance Gas Transportation Infrastructure Limited, 
the closely-held firm whose shares are not listed on stock exchanges, has a colourful and 
controverisal past.

According to a story broken by Dev Chatterjee in the Business Standard on June 12, this is the 
first time a company in the Reliance group led by Mukesh Ambani has sought and obtained 
rescheduling of loans extended to it by Indian public-sector banks.

RGTIL's losses for the financial year that ended on March 31, 2015, stood at Rs 436 crore on an 
income of Rs 1,357 crore. In the previous year, the company's losses were nearly eight times 
higher at Rs 3,403 crore on a slightly higher income of Rs 1,412 crore. The company's debt was 
above Rs 16,000 crore at the end of March.

RGTIL has stated that it had received a sanction from nationalised banks to repay the principal 
loan amount outstanding by 2030-’31 instead of 2019-’20. Such a rescheduling is considered most 
generous.

Closely held company

Why did this company seek and obtain a new schedule for repaying the loans it had received from a 
consortium of banks? And what is the role of this particular firm in the bigger affairs of RIL, 
India's biggest private corporate entity, and its associates?

RGTIL is a company in which Mukesh Ambani holds a personal stake is 42.5%. Being a closely-held 
private company, its accounts are not part of the financial statements that are disclosed by RIL, 
which is a widely-held company whose shares are listed on stock exchanges. Yet this company plays 
an important role in the activities of the wider business empire controlled by the Ambani family.

RGTIL owns and operates a nearly 1,400-kilometre-long natural gas transportation pipeline from 
Kakinada in Andhra Pradesh to Bharuch in Gujarat that passes through four states including 
Karnataka and Maharashtra.

The company's losses are apparently on account of a sharp fall in production from the D6 block in the Krishna-Godavari basin in the Bay of Bengal, where a company controlled by the Reliance group 
has been contracted by the government to explore and extract natural gas. The decline in gas 
output has, in turn, led to significant decline in the utilisation of the pipeline's capacity.

In 1999, when RIL obtained the rights to explore the D6 block, it was estimated that gas output 
would be in the region of 40 million metric standard cubic metres a day. This figure was 
subsequently doubled and the pipeline that was built to transport the gas assumed gas production 
would be 80 mmscmd.

These estimates seemed reasonable when in March 2010 gas production reached nearly 70 mmscmd and 
RIL crowed about its achievement. However, gas output started dipping thereafter.

Falling output

In 2010-’11, production averaged less than 56 mmscmd and in the following year, gas output dropped 
below 43 mmscmd. Worse was to follow. In 2012-’13, production shrunk to 26 mmscmd and by December 
2014, the average output of gas from the KG-D6 block had come down to a meagre 10 mmscmd, an 
eighth of the amount had been envisaged.

Reliance group spokespersons claimed the fall in gas production was on account of "natural" and 
"unanticipated" factors, whereas others – including the Comptroller and Auditor General of India 
and a Parliamentary committee – were sceptical about their explanation.

They contended that output had been "deliberately" suppressed in anticipation of higher prices of 
gas which are administered by the government. RIL protested.

Over the last three years, the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas has levied penalties on the 
contracting company led by RIL,  disallowing it from recovering costs incurred to the extent of 
nearly $ 2.4 billion (or around Rs 15,000 crores at the prevailing exchange rate). The company 
again protested.

A number of petitions on these and related issues are currently under adjudication in the Supreme 
Court. In addition, arbitration proceedings are proceeding concurrently.

The drastic fall in gas production has not merely adversely affected the fortunes of RGTIL. Power plants which were set up to use the gas are operating way below their installed capacities. 
According to a December 2013 report of a Parliamentary committee, power projects with investments 
of Rs 40,000 crore are "stranded" because of non-availability of gas.

In March, the Union cabinet approved a plan to subsidise imported liquefied natural gas to help 
these stranded projects.

Intense battle

RGTIL was created in March 2003 as a 100% subsidiary of RIL. In August 2004, RGTIL was granted 
approval by the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas to build a pipeline to transport gas from 
Kakinada to Bharuch.

Between November 2004 and June 2005, the Ambani brothers Mukesh and Anil fought a bitter battle in 
public over control of the assets of the businesses of the family.

On April 21, 2005, an unusual development took place. For a paltry sum of Rs 500,000, RGTIL was 
taken out of the ambit of RIL and converted into an "independent" company controlled entirely by 
Mukesh Ambani.

The way this was done presents a typical case study of how Ambani family members structure their 
personal assets, using a slew of companies with extremely complicated cross-holdings – that is, 
shares held by a clutch of corporate entities in one another – with loyal employees and associates 
acting as directors in these firms.

The story of RGTIL then took an interesting turn, The Union budget for 2009-’10, announced by 
Pranab Mukherjee, who was the finance minister at the time (and is now President of India) on July 
6, 2009, inserted Section 35AD in the Income Tax Act, 1961, to allow 100% of the capital 
expenditure incurred on setting up and operating a natural gas or a crude oil pipeline as a tax 
deduction in the very first year of operation.

This was the only business of its kind in India in which the entire capital expenditure incurred 
was allowed to be treated as revenue expenditure in the first year of operation. The estimated 
benefit to RGTIL was a staggering Rs 20,000 crore.

Deal is investigated

Four years later, in 2013, a report was drafted by the Serious Fraud Investigation Office  in the 
Ministry of Corporate Affairs investigating the manner in which firms in the Reliance group had 
sought to control a company which controlled the NewsX television channel.

The draft report, which was presented in the Supreme Court on November 11 that year by lawyer 
Prashant Bhushan as an annexure to a public interest litigation petition, alleged that there had 
been a "fraudulent" set of transactions linked to corporate entities controlled by lobbyist Niira 
Radia, a Mauritius-based associate of multinational investment firm New Silk Route (whose founders 
included Rajat Gupta and Raj Rajaratnam who were been found guilty of insider trading charges in 
the United States) and RGTIL.

The Serious Fraud Investigation Office draft report claims that the RIL chief quietly and without 
any disclosure "stripped RGTIL from RIL and converted into his personal property at a meagre 
price" through a "maze of private companies" that enabled India's richest man to "convert" a 
wholly-owned subsidiary of the country's largest private corporate entity into his "personal 
property" in a "classic manoeuvre".

RGTIL also figures among the firms involved in the so-called Biometrix case. In 2013, the 
Enforcement Directorate in the Ministry of Finance (which is responsible for enforcing the Foreign 
Exchange Management Act and the Prevention of Money Laundering Act) wrote to the Reserve Bank of 
India seeking its advice on the legality or otherwise of a loan of Rs 6,530.36 crore ($1.62 
billion) by an overseas branch of ICICI Bank to a Singapore-based company called Biometrix 
Corporation that later returned to the country allegedly as foreign direct investment through the 
issuance of financial instruments in four Reliance group companies, including RGTIL.

The range of transactions relating to this company underscores its importance to the sprawling 
business empire of India's richest man.

Introduction
Reliance Industries Limited is the second biggest business empire of India in terms of profit 
generation. They also are the second largest publicly traded company with shareholder count in 
millions. It is one of the companies to be listed in Fortune 500 at rank 215 as per the 2016 list. 
It is also among the top 250 Global Energy Company by Platts (2016), and is ranked highly at 
number 8. The company continues to go strong despite the split between the Ambani brothers in 
2005-06.

Dhirubhai Ambani started Reliance Industries Limited with his second cousin in the year 1966. He 
had a heart stroke in the year 1986 and handed the empire to his sons Mukesh and Anil. By then, 
Reliance had made a fortune and established itself as one of the premiere privately owned business 
empires of the country. The Ambani family was counted among the richest families in the world.

Mukesh Dhirubhai Ambai, elder son of Dhirubhai Ambani, is the present CEO of Reliance Industries 
Limited. He holds 44.7% of the shares of the company and is one of the most influential persons in 
the country. He was the 36th most powerful person in 2014 as per the Forbes most powerful people 
of the world. Currently, he has created a sensation by launching Reliance Jio services which 
resulted in massive share drops of all the competitors.

Reliance Commercial Corporation was formed in the 1960s. In 1966, Reliance Textiles Industries Pvt 
Ltd was founded in Maharashtra. Vimal became a major brand that Reliance created in the years 
following 1975 when company expanded business in textiles. The Initial Public Offering came in 
1977. It was a roaring success with 7-fold over-subscription.

Reliance Industries Limited was technically formed in 1985 when Reliance Textiles Industries Pvt 
Ltd was renamed to Reliance Industries Limited. It was with an eye of expansion to other 
industries. While the textiles department soared in the 80s and 90s, there were other 
developments. 1991-92 saw Hazira Petrochemical Plant being commissioned- making their entry to 
petrochemicals and energy. Then came Reliance Petroleum. 1995-96 saw Reliance Telecom enter the 
market.

Reliance Petroleum and Reliance Industries Limited continued to grow as the most powerful parts of 
Reliance Industries, and apart from a minor hiccup of split between the brothers- nothing has 
stopped Reliance Industries. With Reliance Jio, the trend has already been towards further up.
